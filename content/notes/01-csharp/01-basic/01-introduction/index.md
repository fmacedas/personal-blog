**What's CSharp?**

C# is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It's an object-oriented language, meaning it uses objects to structure code and data, and is used to build a variety of applications. C# is known for its ease of learning, strong community support, and ability to produce highly performant code. 

**.NET SDK Instalation**

The easiest way to have the .NET SDK installed in your personal computer is to download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). You can also use other IDE, but you will need to install the [SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks) manually.
